# 🔌 Logisim Projects

This repository showcases digital logic simulations built using Logisim. These projects were designed to reinforce my understanding of computer architecture, binary arithmetic, and instruction cycles.

## 🧩 Projects Included

### 1. Seven-Segment Decoder
Simulates numeric display logic using combinational circuits. Converts binary input into signals for a seven-segment LED display.

### 2. Fetch-Execute Cycle
Models the instruction cycle of a basic CPU, including memory fetch, decode, and execution stages. Demonstrates control flow and register interaction.

### 3. Two’s Complement Adder
Performs binary addition with support for negative numbers using two’s complement logic. Includes overflow detection and bitwise operations.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Logisim
- Digital logic design principles
- Binary arithmetic and control logic
